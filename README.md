# ospool-images

It is a set of base images to be used for high throughput computing,
for example when running jobs on the OSG OSPool.

These images are built automatically, and published to the OSG Harbor
instances. User will be able to use these images in their jobs, either via
CVMFS:

    /cvmfs/singularity.opensciencegrid.org/htc

Or via OSDF (pointer will soon be added here).
